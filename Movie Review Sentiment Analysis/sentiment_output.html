"Naturally in a <span class="pos">film</span> who's main <span class="pos">themes</span> are of mortality, nostalgia, and <span class="neg">loss</span> of <span class="pos">innocence</span> it is perhaps not <span class="pos">surprising</span> that it is rated more <span class="pos">highly</span> by older viewers than younger ones. However there is a craftsmanship and completeness to the <span class="pos">film</span> which anyone can enjoy. The <span class="pos">pace</span> is steady and constant, the characters full and engaging, the relationships and interactions natural showing that you do not need floods of <span class="pos">tears</span> to show emotion, screams to show fear, shouting to show dispute or violence to show anger. Naturally Joyce's <span class="pos">short</span> story lends the <span class="pos">film</span> a ready made structure as <span class="pos">perfect</span> as a <span class="pos">polished</span> diamond, but the <span class="pos">small</span> changes Huston <span class="pos">makes</span> such as the inclusion of the poem fit in neatly. It is <span class="pos">truly</span> a <span class="pos">masterpiece</span> of tact, subtlety and overwhelming beauty."

"This movie is a <span class="neg">disaster</span> within a <span class="neg">disaster</span> film.

"All in all, this is a movie for kids. We <span class="pos">saw</span> it tonight and my child <span class="pos">loved</span> it.

"Afraid of the Dark <span class="neg">left</span> me with the <span class="neg">impression</span> that several <span class="pos">different</span> screenplays were written, all too <span class="pos">short</span> for a feature <span class="pos">length</span> film, then spliced <span class="pos">together</span> clumsily into this Frankenstein's monster.

"...as valuable as King Tut's tomb! (OK, <span class="neg">maybe</span> not THAT valuable, but <span class="pos">worth</span> hunting down if you can). I notice no one has commented on this movie for some years, and I <span class="pos">hope</span> a <span class="pos">fresh</span> post <span class="pos">will</span> spark some new comments. This is a <span class="pos">film</span> that I remembered only <span class="pos">snippets</span> of from childhood, and only <span class="pos">saw</span> recently when I <span class="neg">tired</span> of waiting for Fox to <span class="pos">honour</span> its own past, and hunted down the Korean DVD (in English, but with unremovable Korean subtitles). I won't go through another long <span class="neg">plot</span> description - <span class="neg">suffice</span> to say that <span class="pos">seeing</span> it for the <span class="pos">first</span> <span class="pos">time</span> in its <span class="neg">proper</span> widescreen format <span class="neg">left</span> me agape at the vistas and the scope of the <span class="pos">film.</span> The matte <span class="pos">paintings</span> <span class="pos">still</span> hold up, and the palace sets are <span class="pos">truly</span> breathtaking. But it is the <span class="pos">smaller</span> scale details that lend this <span class="pos">film</span> its depth and richness, offering a glimpse into the lifestyles of Egypt's <span class="neg">poor</span> as <span class="pos">well</span> as its elite. The bazaars, hovels, docks, embalming houses, and taverns are as <span class="pos">fascinating</span> as Pharaoh's throne room. While <span class="neg">errors</span> abound on the large scale (most notably the dynastic succession), the details are more meticulously researched than the vast majority of Hollywood's <span class="pos">films.</span> Visually, it's not without its <span class="pos">flaws</span> - the <span class="neg">interiors</span> are <span class="pos">often</span> too overly lit and colourful to <span class="pos">blend</span> <span class="neg">seamlessly</span> with the exteriors. <span class="neg">Nevertheless,</span> this is a movie that should be credited for being as audacious in the <span class="pos">small</span> as it is in the large. Tedious? In parts, absolutely. Overacted? Underacted? Yes, both - <span class="pos">though</span> 'understated' <span class="neg">might</span> be a more apt description. Too long? Absolutely not. I wished they had <span class="neg">spent</span> more <span class="pos">time</span> with Sinuhe's experiences in the House of Death, and among the Hittites, and <span class="neg">less</span> with his 'romance' with Nefer, <span class="pos">though.</span> Historically inaccurate? Yes, that too, but so was Shakespeare. Nobody chastises him for it. I <span class="pos">appreciate</span> historical accuracy as <span class="neg">much</span> as the next guy, but ultimately it has to be remembered that cinema is theater, not a <span class="pos">history</span> <span class="neg">lesson."</span>

"'The Mill on the Floss' was one of the lesser novels by Mary Ann Evans, who <span class="neg">wrote</span> under the male pseudonym George Eliot. I <span class="neg">tried</span> to <span class="neg">read</span> this <span class="neg">dull</span> and very turgid novel <span class="pos">years</span> ago, but was <span class="neg">unable</span> to <span class="pos">finish</span> it. I'll review this <span class="pos">film</span> version <span class="neg">solely</span> on its own merits, as I don't know how faithfully it <span class="pos">follows</span> the <span class="neg">original</span> novel.  The <span class="pos">film's</span> opening <span class="neg">credits</span> are printed in an Old English typeface that suggests the mediaeval period, and so it's a very <span class="neg">poor</span> choice for a <span class="pos">film</span> with a 19th-century <span class="neg">setting.</span> (On the other hand, about halfway into the <span class="pos">film,</span> we <span class="pos">see</span> a close-up shot of a handbill advertising an estate auction. This handbill is <span class="neg">set</span> in authentic Victorian type fonts, and <span class="neg">looks</span> *very* convincing.) Most of this <span class="pos">film</span> is extremely convincing in its depiction of the architecture and clothing of early 19th-century England. The precise location of this <span class="pos">film's</span> story is never disclosed, but - judging by the <span class="neg">actors'</span> accents - I'd place it as <span class="neg">somewhere</span> in the Cotswolds, perhaps Warwickshire.  The plot, what there is of it, involves a mill that changes hands a couple of <span class="pos">times</span> (over a couple of decades) between two <span class="pos">rival</span> families, one wealthy and one working-class. I <span class="pos">disagree</span> with another IMDb reviewer who claims that James Mason has only a <span class="pos">small</span> role in this <span class="pos">film.</span> Mason has the largest and most central role in this drama, as the scion of the wealthier family. As the spoilt and petulant Tom Tulliver, Mason is darkly brooding and impetuous. His <span class="pos">performance</span> here belongs in a <span class="neg">better</span> <span class="pos">film:</span> it made me want to <span class="pos">see</span> 'Wuthering Heights' recast with Mason as Heathcliff.  As this is a multi-generational saga (something which George Eliot did <span class="neg">much</span> <span class="neg">better</span> in 'Middlemarch'), several of the main roles in this <span class="pos">film</span> are split among two <span class="neg">actors</span> apiece: child <span class="neg">actors</span> in the prologue, adults in the main narrative. The prologue of this <span class="pos">film</span> features a very well-written scene, establishing Tom Tulliver as wilful and bully-ragging from an early age, and young Philip Wakeham as <span class="neg">decent</span> and thoughtful. Through hard labour, Philip has <span class="pos">earned</span> a halfpenny: Tom <span class="neg">tries</span> to bully it away from him, but is unwilling to take the coin by brute force: he wants Philip to *give* it to him. All the child <span class="neg">actors</span> in this movie, male and female, are talented and attractive. Unfortunately, all of the children speak their dialogue in posh plummy-voiced accents that are utterly <span class="pos">unlike</span> the accents of the <span class="neg">actors</span> and <span class="neg">actresses</span> who play those same roles as adults. This discrepancy calls <span class="pos">attention</span> to the staginess of the <span class="neg">material.</span> Regrettably, <span class="neg">none</span> of the <span class="pos">later</span> <span class="neg">scenes</span> are as <span class="pos">good</span> as this prologue.  The climax features a crowd of labourers in a rainstorm, <span class="neg">much</span> <span class="neg">better</span> <span class="pos">paced</span> and <span class="neg">photographed</span> than the <span class="pos">earlier</span> <span class="neg">scenes.</span> But modern viewers (in Britain, at least) can no longer take this sort of <span class="neg">material</span> seriously. By now, practically every British comedian has done a  "trouble at t' mill, squire " comedy routine, parodying precisely this subject matter, so I had <span class="pos">difficulty</span> <span class="neg">watching</span> this movie with a straight face.  The character <span class="neg">actress</span> Martita Hunt is <span class="pos">good</span> in a <span class="pos">small</span> role, but the opening <span class="neg">credits</span> (in that Old English typeface) misspell her forename as 'Marita'. I'll rate this <span class="neg">dull</span> movie 3 <span class="neg">points</span> out of 10: one <span class="neg">point</span> apiece for James Mason's <span class="pos">performance,</span> the early scene with the children, and the authentic Victorian <span class="neg">typesetting</span> in that auctioneer's handbill."

There is a story, but so <span class="neg">much</span> in unanswered that the viewer, like me, feels a <span class="pos">bit</span> <span class="neg">left</span> out and unfulfilled.  The <span class="pos">film</span> begins with a woman, her boyfriend and her Westie (that's a dog, by the way) going to a <span class="pos">lonely</span> beach. The lady speaks with an <span class="neg">accent</span> that, at <span class="pos">times,</span> is a <span class="pos">bit</span> difficult to follow. Given that I am hard of hearing, I sure would have <span class="pos">loved</span> if it had been closed captioned. Anyway, the boyfriend goes for a <span class="pos">swim</span> while she naps. When she awakens, her dog is gone. She panics and <span class="pos">makes</span> the guy follow her all about <span class="neg">looking</span> for the dog. They <span class="neg">spend</span> most of the <span class="pos">time</span> arguing and being disagreeable. Then, out of the blue, they stop to have sex. Later, they <span class="pos">find</span> the dog--end of story.  As <span class="neg">far</span> as the characters go, both <span class="pos"><span class="neg">seemed</span></span> rather <span class="neg">dysfunctional</span> and unlikable. She was a fussy and demanding lady and he <span class="pos"><span class="neg">seemed</span></span> to have contempt for her. When you wondered why they were together, their little sex break showed what <span class="pos">bond</span> kept them together.  Some <span class="neg">might</span> like the characterizations--I kept <span class="pos"><span class="pos">finding</span></span> the people <span class="neg">irritating</span> and unreal--more like <span class="neg">caricatures</span> than people you <span class="neg">might</span> meet or know. Also, the payoff for all this <span class="neg">just</span> isn't <span class="pos">worth</span> the wait (unless you want to <span class="pos">see</span> the guy naked)."

"I'm not really <span class="neg">much</span> of an Abbott & Costello fan (although I do <span class="pos">enjoy</span>  "Who's On First ") and, to be honest, there wasn't <span class="neg">much</span> in this movie that would inspire me to <span class="pos">watch</span> any more of their work. It wasn't really bad. It had some <span class="neg">mildly</span> amusing <span class="neg">scenes,</span> and actually a very convincing giant <span class="pos">played</span> by Buddy Baer, but somehow, given the fame of the <span class="pos">duo</span> and the esteem in which they're generally held, I have to say I was <span class="pos">expecting</span> more. As the story goes, the pair stumble into a babysitting job, and during the reading of Jack & The Beanstalk as a bedtime story (with the kid reading it to Costello), Costello's Jack <span class="neg">falls</span> <span class="neg">asleep</span> and <span class="pos"><span class="pos">dreams</span></span> himself into the story. There's a  "Wizard Of Oz " kind of <span class="pos">feel</span> to the story, in that the characters in the <span class="pos">dream</span> are all the equivalents of real-life acquaintances of Jack, and the movie opens in black & white and shifts to colour during the <span class="pos">dream</span> sequence. The fight <span class="neg">scenes</span> between Jack and the giant and the dance scene between Jack and Polly (Dorothy Ford) are among the amusing parts of the movie. Polly, of course, <span class="pos">also</span> leads to one of the questions of the movie - what happened to her? Jack and gang <span class="neg">apparently</span> <span class="neg">left</span> her behind in the giant's castle! I know - it was <span class="neg">just</span> a <span class="pos">dream,</span> so who cares. Still - I wondered. There were <span class="pos">also</span> a couple of cute song and dance routines. My 4 year old giggled a <span class="pos">bit</span> during this, so she was <span class="pos">able</span> to <span class="pos">appreciate</span> some of the humour. I found it to be an <span class="pos">acceptable</span> timewaster, but certainly not <span class="neg">anything</span> that would <span class="neg">convince</span> you of Abbott and Costello as <span class="pos">comic</span> geniuses. 4/10"

"I <span class="neg">completely</span> forgot that I'd <span class="pos">seen</span> this within a couple of days, which is pretty revealing in itself. The umpteenth version of Gaston 'Phantom of the Opera' Leroux's locked-door country-house mystery, I had heard that it was an <span class="neg">engaging</span> and <span class="pos">witty</span> update. So it appeared from the <span class="pos">likable</span> title <span class="pos">sequence</span> and a few <span class="pos">neat</span> touches in the opening scene, but the <span class="pos">film</span> very quickly ground to a halt and became vaguely <span class="neg">tedious</span> and <span class="pos">wholly</span> unsatisfying.  As a mystery the <span class="neg">major</span> <span class="neg">problem</span> is that it is fundamentally unsolvable by the audience: like the <span class="neg">worst</span> Agatha Christies, it depends on a <span class="neg">character</span> appearing in the final <span class="neg">act</span> with a wealth of background <span class="pos">information</span> that we have not been privy to. As a <span class="pos">film,</span> be it comedy or thriller, the <span class="pos">crucial</span> <span class="neg">problem</span> is that <span class="neg">characterisation</span> is almost non-existent. With the <span class="neg">exception</span> of the killer, <span class="pos">everyone</span> is a face-value version of the typical suspects in the typical country-house murder story - reporter, endangered heiress, suspicious fiancé, scatterbrained scientist <span class="pos">father</span> (a <span class="pos">surprisingly</span> <span class="neg">poor</span> Michel Lonsdale), etc. There's no depth and little of interest, and the frequently over-ripe or misjudged <span class="pos">performances</span> don't help. You <span class="neg">frankly</span> don't <span class="neg">care</span> about anyone in it, so there's no jeopardy or suspense. Only Claude Rich and, in the <span class="pos">last</span> reel, Pierre Arditi <span class="pos">get</span> <span class="neg">anything</span> to work with, and only in the <span class="pos">last</span> reel does the <span class="pos">film</span> <span class="pos">get</span> close to a sense of resonance that is too fleeting to be really effective.  For the rest, we <span class="pos">get</span> <span class="neg">endless</span> <span class="neg">exposition</span> and a couple of ineffective would-be <span class="pos">comic</span> <span class="neg">set</span> <span class="pos">pieces</span> (a <span class="neg">promising</span> one with a photographer trapped inside a <span class="pos">grandfather</span> clock is <span class="neg">just</span> too <span class="neg"><span class="neg">poorly</span></span> <span class="pos">thought</span> through to pay off), with Dennis Podalydes <span class="neg">reduced</span> to Irving the Explainer for the <span class="pos">last</span> third of the picture. I'm not fond of country-house movies or Agatha Christie style whodunits, so those who are <span class="neg">might</span> cit it a <span class="pos">lot</span> more slack, but I found it a <span class="neg">poor</span> show.

"I like <span class="pos"><span class="neg">action</span></span> movies. I have a softspot for  "B " <span class="pos">flicks</span> with <span class="neg">bad</span> dialogue and <span class="neg">wooden</span> <span class="neg"><span class="neg">acting.</span></span> So, I've been wracking my <span class="neg">brain</span> to come up with one of my guilty pleasures that was <span class="neg">worse</span> than this blockbuster. I can't. You'd be hard <span class="neg">pressed</span> to put <span class="pos"><span class="pos">together</span></span> a bigger piece of cr*p than this Bruce <span class="pos">Willis</span> vehicle.  Armageddon is the story (and I use that term loosely) of a team of  "Super-Drillers " flying off to destroy an asteroid before it destroys the Earth. Realistic? Not really. But who cares? It's an <span class="pos"><span class="neg">action</span></span> flick. I'm not blasting the <span class="neg">premise.</span>  Minor spoilers:  The movie begins with a couple of <span class="neg">scenes</span> designed to introduce the threat and the <span class="neg">characters.</span> Bruce <span class="pos">Willis</span> is the tough-as-nails leader of the team, and spends his <span class="pos">first</span> <span class="pos">bit</span> of screen <span class="pos">time</span> chasing around Ben Affleck with a gun for the <span class="pos">unforgiveable</span> <span class="neg">act</span> of sleeping with his daughter. For some reason, that didn't <span class="neg">make</span> me laugh. It was forced, like <span class="neg">everything</span> in this movie.  The team is called in because they're the only people in the <span class="neg">whole</span> wide <span class="pos">world</span> who can drill the asteroid. Okay, I'm prepared to accept that <span class="neg">premise</span> if it <span class="pos">gets</span> us to the <span class="pos"><span class="neg">action</span></span> - the <span class="neg">supposed</span> meat of the movie. More <span class="neg">attempts</span> at humor, with each <span class="neg">character</span> going out to do some crazy, nutty <span class="neg">thing</span> before blast off. Again, lame. Finally, they take off. Here's where the movie really pi**ed me off. They arrive on the rock, and <span class="neg">set</span> to work.

"If I was only allowed to <span class="pos">watch</span> one program in my <span class="neg">entire</span> life, I would <span class="pos">definitely</span> have to pick  "The Chaser's War on Everything ".

It is <span class="neg">just</span> so Amazing, the <span class="pos">boys</span> aren't afraid to do anything.  Whether it's <span class="pos">dress</span> up as Hitler to <span class="pos">get</span> into a Polish Club, or push a MASSIVE ball of <span class="neg">string</span> around Melbourne to try out the tourism ad's or <span class="pos">rock</span> up to the Coke <span class="pos">factory</span> naked in a bath with $2.40 to <span class="pos">buy</span> some water. The Chaser <span class="pos">boys</span> <span class="pos">will</span> go there.

"A <span class="pos">truly</span> terrific, <span class="pos">touching</span> <span class="pos">film.</span> Female melodrama at its finest, with a <span class="pos">lot</span> of comedy: <span class="pos">great</span> dialogue, characters and writing.

"Ronald Coleman had been a star of the screen for several <span class="pos">years</span> when talkies <span class="pos">came</span> in, and what a boost it was to his career. His Oxford English <span class="neg">accent</span> is so <span class="pos">enthralling</span> I could listen to him recite the farmer's almanac and not be bored.  Coleman <span class="pos">plays</span> Willie Hale, a 30ish playboy from a wealthy <span class="pos">family</span> who spends his <span class="pos">time</span> womanizing and gambling. <span class="pos">Yet,</span> he's a <span class="pos">likable</span> rogue - not only <span class="pos">likable</span> from the standpoint of the audience but by <span class="pos">family</span> and <span class="pos">friends</span> too. He has <span class="pos">yet</span> again gone broke <span class="pos">due</span> to his constant gambling and sells off his possessions in a foreign location to <span class="neg">settle</span> his debts and provide passage back home to England. When he gets there, he at <span class="pos">first</span> is met by a <span class="pos">father</span> who <span class="pos">insists</span> he'll kick him out - he's had it with Willie and his layabout ways. However, five <span class="neg">minutes</span> alone in a room with Willie and his charm, and Willie is not only forgiven by dad, dad has given him one hundred pounds to boot.  Willie then goes for a <span class="pos">day's</span> recreation with his sister and her friend, Dorothy Hope (Loretta Young). Dorothy is <span class="neg">set</span> to be engaged to the Grand Duke Paul that very night, mainly <span class="neg">just</span> because her dad wants royalty in the <span class="pos">family,</span> and there is nobody <span class="neg">else</span> special in her life. That changes after her <span class="pos">day</span> with Willie, and <span class="pos">soon</span> there is a scandal brewing as Dorothy <span class="pos">refuses</span> to go through with the marriage as planned.  Ronald Coleman is <span class="pos">always</span> a <span class="pos"><span class="pos">delight</span></span> to <span class="pos">watch</span> in these early <span class="neg">talking</span> <span class="pos">films</span> he did for Sam Goldwyn where he is playing the confident adventurer or cad or both. He has a demeanor akin to Errol Flynn, but he is <span class="neg">unable</span> to display Flynn's <span class="pos">physical</span> agility <span class="pos">due</span> to a disabling wound he received during World War I. However, what he <span class="neg">lacks</span> in <span class="pos">physical</span> agility Coleman <span class="pos">always</span> made up in agility of soul. Loretta Young, only 17 when this picture was made, <span class="pos">shows</span> the <span class="pos">beginning</span> of her trademark <span class="pos">sweet</span> girl that can erupt into a ball of fire when the occasion calls for it. Myrna Loy <span class="pos">plays</span> Willie's girl from the past - Mary Crayle - a showgirl. Here Myrna is <span class="pos">still</span> playing a part similar to the exotic vamp parts she <span class="pos">got</span> stuck with so <span class="pos">often</span> over at Warner Brothers when she was a contract player from 1926 until shortly before this movie was made in 1930.  This is pretty <span class="neg">much</span> a <span class="pos">light</span> and breezy <span class="pos">romantic</span> comedy from start to finish. If you're in a mood for the kind of escapist entertainment that <span class="pos">lightened</span> the hearts of audiences during the Great Depression, this little <span class="pos">film</span> fits the bill."

"Footprints is a very <span class="neg">interesting</span> movie that is <span class="pos">somewhat</span> difficult to categorize.  "Psychological <span class="pos">thriller</span> " is the most <span class="pos">appropriate</span> description I can <span class="pos">think</span> of. The female protagonist, Alice Cespi, <span class="pos">discovers</span> that she doesn't <span class="pos">remember</span> <span class="neg">anything</span> of the <span class="pos">last</span> three days. The only clue she has is a torn photo of a hotel. She is <span class="pos">also</span> haunted by a recurring, very vivid, <span class="pos">dream</span> about a science fiction movie that she <span class="pos">believes</span> she <span class="pos">saw</span> many <span class="pos">years</span> ago. In her pursuit of the truth behind her amnesia she doesn't <span class="pos">trust</span> anyone, but little by little it becomes <span class="neg">obvious</span> that she has visited the town where the hotel is located before. This is an exciting flick whose main virtue is that it is virtually impossible to predict how the events <span class="pos">will</span> unfold, and particularly, how it <span class="pos">will</span> end. The <span class="pos">unusual</span> loneliness of the main character and the unreliability of <span class="pos">everyone</span> <span class="neg">else</span> ensure that the <span class="pos">good</span> old paranoid feeling is <span class="pos">present</span> <span class="pos">throughout</span> the film, whereas <span class="pos">beautiful</span> colors and some spectacularly filmed <span class="pos">sequences</span> <span class="neg">make</span> this a visually <span class="neg">attractive</span> movie as well. The important part of the one and only Nicoletta Elmi, <span class="pos">everyone's</span> all <span class="pos">time</span> <span class="pos">favorite</span> redheaded <span class="neg">obnoxious</span> child star of Italian horror, is an extra bonus."

"This <span class="pos">love</span> story between an American journalist and an Eurasian lady doctor does not contain <span class="neg">much</span> conflict, since she is largely Westernized (having studied in London), nor any fireworks, since she <span class="neg">behaves</span> rather restrained. What little <span class="neg">interest</span> the story <span class="pos">manages</span> to raise is knocked down further by their <span class="neg">wooden</span> dialogs. They are <span class="neg">supposed</span> to be two cosmopolitan intellectuals, but talk as if the words are put in their mouths by a Hollywood hack who is not <span class="neg">much</span> of one himself. The movie <span class="pos">also</span> suffers from an <span class="pos">amazing</span> <span class="neg">lack</span> of realism - a <span class="neg">completely</span> deserted beach in crowded little Hongkong, overrun by a million Chinese refugees? And a <span class="neg">presumably</span> accomplished American journalist in his 40s who doesn't know what a hysterectomy is? Hollywood ideas. Finally  "the song ". After hearing it an estimated twenty <span class="pos">times</span> <span class="pos">throughout</span> the movie, starting <span class="pos">right</span> with the credits, it <span class="pos">tends</span> to loose some of its emotional impact, <span class="neg">sorry</span> to say."

"This is not your typical Indian film. There is some <span class="pos">great</span> sense of <span class="pos">humanity,</span> and the characters are pretty realistic. There is <span class="pos">great</span> dynamism in the interpersonal relationships, and there is a sense of guilt, grief, passion, passivity among the many characters. While <span class="pos">seeing</span> this, one gets a <span class="pos">feel</span> for the heavy burden of the 5000 <span class="pos">years</span> of layers and layers of <span class="pos">history</span> of social existence of one of the oldest civilizations. The final scene of an <span class="pos">elephant</span> walking away in the <span class="pos">rural</span> area was a <span class="pos">great</span> footnote to such a ancient civilization, and yet, <span class="pos">human</span> relations are <span class="pos">still</span> preserved and nurtured. Saw it on DVD, the two interviews with the <span class="neg">director</span> and the main <span class="neg">actress</span> are very interesting. Was <span class="pos">surprised</span> to learn that the movie has not done <span class="pos">well</span> (or not being shown) in India (... but <span class="neg">maybe</span> not too <span class="pos">surprised).</span> The artistic patrimony of <span class="pos">rural</span> societies is being slowly lost and its inheritance not picked up by younger generations, as some of the older <span class="pos">musicians</span> in the movie are no longer living today. <span class="pos">Great</span> film."

"This movie <span class="neg">tries</span> to be more than it is. First of all, the <span class="neg">acting</span> is horrible. You have to <span class="pos">get</span> past the incredibly <span class="neg">bad</span> delivering of lines and <span class="neg">terrible</span> emoting. The <span class="neg">plot</span> is <span class="pos">quite</span> interesting. A shipwreck occurs (apparently because it was made out of strings and balsa wood), and a couple of guys <span class="pos">find</span> themselves on shore. If this weren't <span class="neg">bad</span> enough, some guy named Count de Sade is living there as well. He <span class="pos">lives</span> in fear of pirates and has gone utterly insane. Anyway, he has a large slave, a young <span class="neg">woman,</span> and some dogs. There's another <span class="neg">woman</span> who doesn't speak and his wife, who is a leper. Anyway, <span class="pos">things</span> <span class="pos">get</span> <span class="neg">bad</span> as these men have to <span class="pos">deal</span> with this <span class="neg">nut</span> case. He is arrogant and likes to <span class="neg">pose</span> and deliver lines. The rest of the movie involves an <span class="neg">attempt</span> to escape. It has an ironic ending which I won't <span class="pos">reveal</span> and it kind of rescues the film. I wouldn't <span class="neg">bother</span> if I were you."

" "The <span class="neg">bad</span> <span class="pos">dreams</span> <span class="pos">always</span> come back again like unwanted friends, " says Marion Fairlie, who with her half-sister, Laura, <span class="pos">lives</span> in a vast mid-Victorian country estate.  "And <span class="pos">last</span> night I found myself in Limmeridge churchyard. <span class="pos">Normally,</span> people who are dead <span class="neg">stay</span> dead, <span class="neg">just</span> as <span class="pos">normally</span> it is the criminals who are locked up rather than the victims. But then, there was <span class="neg">nothing</span> <span class="pos">normal</span> about what happened to us... " And we're off on a first-class Gothic story of madness, deception and villainy, based on Wilkie Collins' <span class="pos">great</span> novel of Victorian mystery. It's a <span class="pos">good</span> <span class="neg">idea</span> to pay close attention, because there are plots within plots, <span class="pos">yet</span> they all center on a cunning and <span class="neg">ruthless</span> scheme which involves, what else, <span class="neg">money,</span> lots of <span class="neg">money.</span>   Marion Fairlie (Tara Fitzgerald) and her sister, Laura Fairlie <span class="neg">(Justine</span> Wadell) are devoted to each other. Marion is fierce and protective; Laura is softer and <span class="neg">much</span> more romantic. Marion has no <span class="neg">money</span> of her own; Laura <span class="pos">will</span> inherit riches when she comes of age. Marion has no marriage prospects that we know of; Laura has been pledged <span class="pos">sometime</span> <span class="pos">ago</span> to Sir Percival Glyde (James Wilby), an <span class="neg">altogether</span> too <span class="pos">charming</span> aristocrat. They are the wards of their uncle, a fussy, condescending, immensely self-centered hypochondriac (Ian Richardson). All <span class="pos"><span class="neg">seems</span></span> to be <span class="pos">quite</span> routine, but then a young artist, Walter Hartright (Andrew Lincoln), is engaged to teach them drawing and artistic appreciation. And when he arrives at night to the local train station, there is no carriage, so off he sets out on foot to the estate. In the dark woods he encounters a strange <span class="neg">woman,</span> dressed all in white, wandering about and speaking of <span class="pos">things</span> he does not understand, who then disappears. Are we uneasy? Yes, and so is he and the <span class="pos">sisters</span> when they come to realize the strange <span class="neg">woman</span> <span class="neg">looks</span> <span class="neg">much</span> like Laura. Later, does <span class="pos">love</span> emerge between Walter and Laura? Does a bud bloom? Is there a misunderstanding that sends Walter away and results in Laura marrying Sir Percival? Does a canker gnaw? And do <span class="pos">secrets</span> slowly come to <span class="pos">light</span> about the relationships among Laura, Marian and the <span class="neg">woman</span> in white...do we learn to be <span class="pos">deeply</span> suspicious of Sir Percival's intentions...do we come to <span class="pos">enjoy</span> the style and <span class="pos">manners</span> of Sir Percival's close friend, Count Fosco (Simon Callow)...and do we eventually realize the foul depths of depravity, as <span class="pos">well</span> as the power of honor and <span class="pos">true</span> <span class="pos">love,</span> that humanity is capable of? Do we visit Victorian insane asylums, <span class="pos">see</span> <span class="neg">falls</span> from high towers, dig open graves in the middle of the night and <span class="pos">watch</span> retribution arrive amidst the <span class="pos">roaring</span> flames of a locked church?   <span class="pos">Well,</span> of course, and it's a grand <span class="pos">journey</span> for us.   This BBC/Masterpiece Theater program features <span class="pos">fine</span> <span class="neg"><span class="neg">acting</span></span> and <span class="pos">outstanding</span> <span class="neg">production</span> values. To fit Collins' 500-plus-page novel into a television show of <span class="neg">less</span> than 120 <span class="neg">minutes</span> means a <span class="pos">good</span> <span class="pos">deal</span> had to be cut or abridged, and some changes were made most likely to achieve <span class="pos">greater</span> <span class="pos"><span class="neg">impact</span></span> in the little <span class="pos">time</span> available. <span class="pos">Still,</span> taken on its own terms, the <span class="neg">production</span> of The <span class="neg">Woman</span> in White in my <span class="pos">opinion</span> <span class="pos">works</span> very <span class="pos">well</span> as a moody, romantic, dark television tale. Tara Fitzgerald as Marion <span class="pos">gives</span> a commanding <span class="pos">performance</span> as a <span class="neg">woman</span> determined to protect and then <span class="neg">save</span> her sister. James Wilby as Sir Percival <span class="pos">manages</span> the clever feat of slowly letting us <span class="pos">see</span> the depraved slime beneath the skin, who <span class="pos">still</span> has charm amidst the villainy. Ian Richardson as the young women's uncle almost <span class="pos">steals</span> the show. He <span class="pos">gives</span> such a bossy and pungent <span class="pos">performance</span> it almost unbalances the story every <span class="pos">time</span> he appears. Perhaps the weakest of the main parts is Simon Callow as Count Fosco. The Count is <span class="neg">simply</span> a monster, <span class="pos">yet</span> a supremely civilized and <span class="pos">charming</span> one. Collins described him as being of immense girth. Callow does a <span class="pos">fine,</span> mannered <span class="pos">job</span> of it, but to me he <span class="neg">lacks</span> a little of the monstrosity of evil.   At one point, Marian <span class="pos">tells</span> us,  "My sister and I are so fond of Gothic novels, we <span class="pos"><span class="pos">sometimes</span></span> <span class="neg">act</span> as if we were in them. " Little did she know what was in store for herself and Laura."
